## What is Carol?

Carol is a simple discord bot with multi purpose (like administration, diversion, utility, etc...)

AAIO (Almost All In One)!

Carol is a lot inspired on [Loritta](https://github.com/LorittaBot/Loritta) and Carol extremely █████ she!

Carol wants to make the world a more cool place to live.

> Carol is currently in beta and it's subject to have a lot of changes on the future.

## What Carol can do:

- Automoderation.
- Timeout those "underatted" peoples who Span.
- Divert others.
- Create funny interactions with members.
- And much more!

## Future of Carol:

My personnel plans for Carol:

- Create a Discord server. (just like "Apartamento da Loritta", the Discord server of Loritta)

- Create something special of Carol. (like a Minecraft server or a Youtube channel for it and etc...)

- Create a Website to entirely configure Carol for a specific discord server. (configure commands, roles, channels, etc...)
